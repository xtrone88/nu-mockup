Many studies meanwhile prove that learners with high self-efficacy expectations rate their chances of success higher and also work more intensively on the achievement of objectives. Goal-oriented acting strengthens the self-efficacy expectation, because associated successes are associated with the own authority.",

    "enabling-and-supporting-desc": "Studies show that talent and excellence in performance are not developed enough in education, e.g. learners who enter education with above-average talent potential are not necessarily those who perform excellently at the end of their education and vice versa. This confirms the findings of expert research (BAIRD, 1985; ERICSSON et al., 1993) that environmental and personality characteristics, such as the working climate, aspects of promotion or performance motivation of learners, are of far greater importance for the development of performance excellence than cognitive abilities.",

An OECD focus analysis has shown that learners from socially disadvantaged milieus not only perform less well, they are also less engaged and therefore more at risk of dropping out of education. The goal is therefore to overcome this discrepancy, i.e. to ensure that learners can develop a high level of commitment regardless of their milieu of origin.",

With a modular structure of the learning material we enable students to deepen their knowledge in specific areas. Furthermore, students have the possibility to organize their learning material themselves which strengthens their social competence and their entrepreneurship. Teachers act as learning coaches and can therefore support students perfectly and efficiently in order to achieve the greatest possible potential in students.",
